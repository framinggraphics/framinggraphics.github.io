      Many of the elements present do not have a real role in the story, most of the time they only serve to enrich the context in which the actions take place.
      The designer has the task of belonging to the film, trying to design coherent props and context elements that evoke the same world, imaginary or real. The works must convey realism in order not to break the “tacit narrative pact”, their realization must be perceived with a high degree of verisimilitude The context graphics props must therefore be discreet, trying to blend in with the context of the film, they must not stand out among the props but they must help the scenography to create the world to be reproduced.
      The graphic designer must be temporally oriented, devising objects consistent with the reference period, always considering that the viewer’s previous experience would unconsciously point out an anachronistic or in any case inappropriate element, producing a judgment of neglect on the film, such as poorly maintained or even incorrect.
      For this order of reasons, careful research and analysis of any graphic design characteristic of that time and place is essential, trying to circumscribe a well-defined style.
      The context graphics in a film are of particular importance and must be weighed even in cases where the context is fictional. In this case, the works must be able to adapt perfectly to imaginary worlds, supernatural elements and alien planets. Fantasy films can present a singularity, in fact they have such imaginative settings but sometimes they evoke past historical periods, consequently the style and the world of appearance in these cases is clear and well defined. If there were printed books in The Lord of the Rings, rather than handwritten, the viewer would be surprised despite the fact that Tolkien’s world has been completely imagined and described by the author. The context, even if imaginative, is still known, and must respect established canons, any type of eccentric or unlikely intervention would be a stretch, if not for a well-defined stylistic choice by the director.</p><br>

    <span><p>The concept of narrative archetypes is a fundamental tool for understanding the purposes and functions of the characters in a story. From this theory it is easy to understand, analyzing the role of a given character, if this is fully expressing its value. The protagonist is called Hero by Christopher Vogler, a well-known American screenwriter, who in his great contribution to the world of storytelling, takes up the theories on narrative patterns in the myths of Joseph Campbell, in turn inspired by the archetypes of the psychologist Carl Gustav Jung, and adapts them to a narrative scheme in which most of the characters, but not only, can be traced back to an archetype.
      Archetypes can be considered as personified symbols of various human qualities, and stories can be read as metaphors of the general human situation, with characters embodying universal archetypal qualities, understandable to both the group and the individual. If each archetype is responsible for embodying a certain function, within the narrative, the role of the herald, or messenger, becomes clear and explicit already from its nomenclature.
      Sticking to the literal definition of the term, the messenger can be defined as a narrative release of the whole story, as a concrete stimulus for the beginning of the journey that interrupts the state of rest. Without the intervention of the herald, the story would not take hold and the film would have no sense of existing.
      The herald in cinema can manifest itself in many forms, physical and otherwise. Often it is a flesh and blood character who announces his task to the hero. A very famous example is the robots C3PO and R2D2 in Star Wars, which by delivering the message of Leia in A New Hope trigger the adventure of Luke Skywalker.
      What interests the graphic designer, however, is the “inanimate” version of the herald. It is interesting to note how often in the cinema the herald is actually not a character but an object that carries the message to the hero and sets off his mission. Many will remember the dazzling brightness of the golden ticket that opened the doors of the Chocolate Factory to little Charlie Bucket or the myriad of magical letters flying out of Harry Potter’s chimney to announce his admission to Hogwarts. In these cases the object is the product of a graphic designer and its usability and particular workmanship make it a structural element of the narrative.</p>

  <span>A graphic scene object can take on a narrative function that we call a link. That is, it allows the director to move from one scene to another, to avoid explicitly filming an event by summarizing it graphically or to introduce a new situation.
    The medium par excellence that allows this passage is the newspaper headline. Countless films make use of this stratagem which, in addition to significantly reducing production costs, can also make the narration of the film more interesting, rhythmic and alternating. L.A. Confidential accelerates the pace on more than one occasion by recounting a series of events with alternating short scenes and cuts in a variety of Los Angeles newspapers, all different and with attention to the smallest details.
    The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a “peeled” physical book that introduces a different story each time.
    A plane ticket can represent the departure of a character without the need to film a possible take-off or the entire journey.</span>

    <span>In some cases the graphic elements that contribute to enrich the background scenography can support a metaphorical reading of the represented situation. An example of this is in the branding of the Dixie Doug Pie Shop in The Shape of Water by Guillermo Del Toro. Co-star Giles, a longtime and declining advertising designer, finds himself sentimentally rejected by the shop owner. The shop with its captivating and modern brand identity for the 60s emphasizes rejection, representing in itself the overcoming of that aesthetic to which Giles was accustomed, as well as a change in habits and customs that was taking place in America that was beginning to make room for fast food.
      To this category of graphic objects that help to give meaning belongs the very famous stack of pages of the keeper Jack Torrence in The Shining. The delusional repetition of a single phrase “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” typewriter, with more than a few errors, and its obsessive layout, are the perfect mirror of the alienation and loss of reason of our protagonist and herald the imminent disaster. In this case, the object is not only part of the scenographic context, but is actively handled and framed in the foreground.
      This type of graphic prop have the task of visually communicating moods, feelings and personalities of the characters in the film, and are particularly effective precisely because, being mute, they leave the viewer a judgment, an evaluation that makes him more involved in the situation that goes on stage.
      More in-depth readings on the social situation of the characters’ provenance can also come from graphic objects worn or shown during the film. In Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix, the graphic representation of the family tree of Sirius Black’s family reflects the personalities and social background of the character and his entire family, allowing an analysis that has helped to deepen the film, undeniably contributing to its success.
      In Escape from New York it is the tattoos, with their typical style that recalls that of the New York gangs, to characterize the characters of the infamous neighborhood and to propose without mediation the social context from which they come.</span>

    <span><p>Sometimes the graphic prop is so important to the story that it is considered a hero prop, which is a significant element for our hero, one that passes through his hands frequently or is often framed. This is the case, for example, of the famous ring from The Lord of the Rings: certainly the most important prop of the saga, the object of desire of the forces of evil and those of good, one of those rings that give the film its name. same. The object is interesting because it is not a simple ring, what differentiates it from other rings is precisely a graphic detail. The writing in “black speech” that surrounds it is a perfect example of how to give prominence and importance to this type of object. In this case, the genius of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien since his books had given the idea and form of a particular alphabet, the only “pure” application of which would have been that on the one ring. It was then the hand of the talented designer Daniel Reeve to transform Tolkien’s alphabet into the mythical calligraphic inscription on the ring: perhaps the most famous calligraphic lettering in the history of cinema made that object unforgettable, made it special and iconic, so much that reproductions of that writing have been used in many pieces of merchandise, artwork that have depopulated all over the world. The authorial hand of designer Daniel Reeve then translated into real fonts all the other alphabets of the saga of the middle earth, written in elven and personal calligraphy of each important character.</p><br>

    <spa>We have seen how a graphic element can be useful to tell something himself, take part in a story or act as an intermediary.
      Instead, it is supportive when it is needed to add something to the situation or action that is taking place. It is supportive when without reading the words “No fire arms in Big Whiskey”, we would not know of the ordinance in The Unforgiven which prohibits passing cowboys from holding firearms during their stop in the town of Big Whiskey.
      The supporting graphics are therefore all the graphics thanks to which the viewer is able to better read a scene, is able to understand something not pronounced by the actors or not explained directly.
      The protagonist Shosanna of Inglourious Basterds shows her documents to the Nazi soldier and, from the scene in which we see that her identity bears a false name, we are relieved to realize that probably nothing will happen to her.</spa>

  <span>An interesting use of graphics for narrative purposes is often present in science fiction films. For the first time, in Westworld (1973), the graphic treatment helps to take the point of view of a machine, a character with artificial intelligence. Michael Crichton uses a pixelated, blurry vision that simulates the recognition of heat, to make us understand that we are watching the film from the perspective of the robot gunfighter. This same technique is then repeatedly taken up in many science fiction films that often reinterpret it in their own way, adapting it to the style of the film, with the graphic interfaces that are best suited to the type of robot / character-machine.
    When Tony Stark activates his final version of the Iron Man armor for the first time, he sees through a graphical interface that makes us understand the potential of what he has built: the information appears before his and our eyes clearly. Designer Jayse Hansen makes sure that crosshairs, maps and gauges populate the screen.
    The most interesting thing about graphical interfaces in movies is that they tend to have almost the opposite functionality to the real ones. The Graphic User Interface in the real world arises from the need to simplify usability compared to what could be obtained through codes and commands; on the contrary, this narrative need for the interface in films makes it more populated, more complicated as there is a need to get the viewer the exact sense of what is happening behind the computer.
    In Iron Man himself, in his first flight attempts, our superhero picks himself up to have a video log of his progress on the project. To do this, he asks his little assistant-machine controlled by artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. to hold the camera: in this scene, on several occasions, the director offers us the view of the camera held by the mechanical arm, and to make us understand it is precisely the graphic interface that presents itself with a clear, recognizable and universal red REC overpressed on the screen.
    This choice of graphic use of the interfaces can give a completely different meaning and cut to a film. Neill Blomkampp uses it to render his film District 9 in a documentary style: the protagonist turns to the camera several times explaining what the MNU is about to do in the operations against the prawns. In Avatar the protagonist Jake shoots himself in a video log, periodically informing “posterity” of his progress in integrating with the Na’vi, when in reality what he is doing is telling the viewer of the film things that the director can avoid. show in the room.</span>

    <span>Not all films have a graphic representation of the title just as not all make it memorable or consistent with the style of the film. In some cases the name of the film is simply applied in post-production in the same font as the opening credits.
      It is interesting when the title is physically present within the scenography of a film. It often happens that the post-produced graphics of the title are transitioned to a real application of the title of the film. This is the case of They Live, when the opening credits lead us to a graffiti with the words “They Live” which matches perfectly with the graphics of the title.
      Present or not, at the beginning of the film or at the end, it is important that it be analyzed as a representative graphic element of the entire film.</span>
