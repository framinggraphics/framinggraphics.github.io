    <span><p>The editorial product created intends to give an account of the research carried out and emphasize the figure of the graphic designer in the field of film productions. The analysis is limited to certain films, selected on the criteria of quantity and quality of the graphic elements present within them. The product will investigate films that start from the 1980s as these are the years in which the figure of the graphic designer begins to be more recognized and increasingly present in the credits of films. Exceptions are some films considered cult before the 80s which deserved to be mentioned for the importance of the graphic contributions within themselves and the comparison they offer in relation to today's films.
      Specifically, the editorial product is structured as an archive in which all the frames are contained, in which graphic elements appear, collected and divided according to the criteria analyzed in the research phase.</p>

    <span><p>The analysis is supported by statistical and informative data based on a cataloging that sees the elements assigned according to 3 classification orders:
      Category. Narrative category to which the element belongs, its role in the film.
      Support. The physical medium on which the graphic element was developed.
      Typography. Analysis of typefaces according to Aldo Novarese's classification, dated 1957 and based on the styles and terminations of graces.
      All the frames of each film can be identified within the publication through a unique code that takes into account the letter assigned to the film in uppercase, the letter that represents the column of a grid in which they are arranged in capital letters and a number that represents the row of the same grid.
      The book is wrapped in a dust jacket with a dual function: one, the explanatory one of the project, with a block diagram that highlights step by step the design and research phases, the other purely summarizing and aesthetic in a poster that collects the most significant frames, the data that summarize the research and the titration of the product.</p>
      <p>The project is potentially reproducible in further volumes that examine other films.
      In addition to the publication, a site has therefore been graphically designed, in which amateurs or graphic designers have the opportunity to give credit to graphic productions in the world of cinema by uploading the frames of films that contain them on the platform, thus expanding the analysis and collection.</p>
